# `Apache Avro custom LogicalType`

This is reference project/template to understand how to define a Custom LogicalType along with Conversion.


TODO:
1. Autogenerate Avro java classes with Converion in built
2. Identify if we need to use velocity templates at all
3. Write detailed post. 

USAGE:
1. `gradle clean build`
2. Run AvroExample (This has the main method)
3. This created a query.avro file.
Use `java -jar avro-tools-1.9.1.jar tojson query.avro` to look at the data in the file.

NOTES:
1. Notice the commented out part in `build.gradle` - The Autogenerated java class does not have the method to get the conversion.
